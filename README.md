## OVERVIEW

The purpose of this analysis is to create a proposal to support a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. To accomplish this, we are using data from NYC rideshare program, through which, we are able to create visualizations to see average biking durations trends and the relationships between gender and popular biking times. 

Below are the results of data that we are using to convince the investors:

This shows the breakdown of ride duration by gender.

## SUMMARY
Through the analysis, we can deduce that many of these users are commuters for work and not tourists, as most of the peak times are around morning and evening commute. Additionally, a majority of the users were male riders and that most of the ride durations peaked at around 5 minutes distance. This makes sense beacuse most people using the service are people who loive in the city and are commuting shorter distance for work. The number of riders dip after 20 minute mark beacuse they have other means of transport for longer travels. Therefore, since Des Moines is mainly a suburb and not a large city like NY, there will be a need for multiple bike station in and around 10 minutes distace of each other.
